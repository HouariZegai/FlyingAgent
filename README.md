### Problem Statement ðŸ”§
Say that we have a mobile agent that moves on a platform distributed on 3 machines having each a container. The role of the agent is to recover the mac address of each machine during his displacement.

### What we doing ðŸ”Œ
Alongside recovering mac address of each machine, we develop a desktop application that use agents to get all the models.information about the PC's neighboring it, like CPU, operating system and basics models.information.

### Requirments âœ…
We use extensively the Jade Platform which allows us to create agents, make platforms, and run them on different machines and various platform, here is a link to the official jade [website](http://jade.tilab.com/).
